# ALDevOpsForGithubExt

AL DevOps for GitHub extends AL-GO for Github Actions and was introduced mainly because of the need to be able to publish Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central (BC) apps not only to the cloud but also to on-prem environments.

## Disclaimer

This is a work in progress and by the way my first public repo for the BC community. So if something doesn't work as expected, please be patient. I'm going to try my best. ;-)
